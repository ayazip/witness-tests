# witness-tests

This repository contains a small set of manually crafted benchmarks for testing validators of violation witnesses in the [witness format 2.0](https://www.sosy-lab.org/research/pub/2024-SPIN.Software_Verification_Witnesses_2.0.pdf).

Each directory in the `benchmarks` directory contains one program and several violation witnesses, either prefixed with `good` of `bad`, marking whether the witness should be confirmed or refuted, respectively.
